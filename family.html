                <p id = "P1"> I am originally from Zimbabwe and I met my fiancee in Zimbabwe before I came to the USA for school and work. We met in 2013 and have been in a relationship since 2014. We have been doing a long distance relationship since then but I have been able to visit nearly every year for at least two months at a time when I go. We got engaged a year ago and she will be joining me here finally as the timing is now right for us to move to the next exciting chapter of our relationship. She is an incredible woman full of joy. We bring the best out of each other and I think that has been a key factor in our relationship that has helped us through the long distance.</p>

                <p id = "P2">I grew up in Zimbabwe as both my parents are Zimabwean and worked professinally there for most of their working years. I have a twin brother and we are very close. Probably would say he is also my best friend. I have an older sister as well and we are also close. We are now an international family as we are now all over the world after graduating highschool. I have some family in Australia and Europe. My brother and I are in the USA though in different states.</p>
