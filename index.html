                <p id = "P1">My name is Tapiwa Piloto and I am 28 yeasrs old. I live in Atlanta Georgia and work in the aeronautics industry as a UAV operator. I wear many hats in the company I work for but my main role is to provide flight instruction to other UAV operators that work for companies that purchase our drones for land surveying. These companies often create 3 dimensional maps of the topography of interest for land development purposes using the LiDAR technology that is equipped on the drone. The images above summarize my life in three pictures. I am a manned and unmanned pilot who is engaged to be married soon and I enjoy adventure and having fun while making unforgettable memories doing so. I travel quite a lot for my job and it has given me neat opportunities to travel through North America. I love nature and being outdoors and so I always try to see the natural attractions at some of the places I go. Feel free to check out the list on the right for some travel suggestions I highly recommend all nature lovers checkout. I have posted links on the side bar on the right so you can get more details.</p>

                <p id = "P2">I decided to get into software and web development because I love problem solving. The satisfaction I get from finding coded solutions to a new software idea or a challenge and seeing something I built work and do the work well is very fulfilling. I also love tacklinkg challenging coding problems and being successful at doing so. I feel that it builds character. Rising up to adversity and not backing away or giving up is something that is integral to my character. Coding is challenging by nature and in a way I feel that this discipline is compatible with my character. I also have a huge interest in tech and computers. The way it has revolutionised the way we live is remarkable. I would like to be a part of this tech revolution and enjoy the fulfillment in seeing what we build as developers improve people's lives.</p>
